    p.downloadsDesc Read a row from the underlying table/view based on the primary key value. Columns from this row are set as field values in the service context. Rows from one r more child-tables can also be read as part of this action. This is a handy-feature when you have header and details design. Like when you read on order, you may want to read all its lines.

    p.downloadsDesc Attributes of Read Action are:
    br
    table
      tr 
        th Attribute name
        th Required?
        th Description
      tr
        td
          p recordName
        td
          p yes
        td
          p
            | Fully qualified record name. This record should have field(s) marked as primary key for this action to be used.
      tr
        td
          p inputSheetName
        td
          p no
        td
          p
            | If this is not specified, primary key is assumed to be a field in service context. If sheet name is specified, then the keys for read operation are taken from sheet and output rows are put into output sheet.
            | If sheet name is specified, and if sheet is not received, we try and get the key from fields, as if sheet is not specified.
      tr
        td
          p outputSheetName
        td
          p no
        td
          p
            | If specified, output row or rows are put into this sheet. If not specified, its behavior depends on inputSheetName. If inputSheetName is specified, then outputSheet defaults to default sheet name for the record.  Else the columns from the row are copied as fields.
      tr
        td
          p childRecords
        td
          p no

            | This feature is available with almost all record based operations. Read rows from one or more child tables for each row in this parent row.
            | A child record has recordName and sheetName as its attributes.  sheetName would default to the value determined based on record.
            | This feature is feasible only if the child record definition takes care of specifying the right parent record.
            | If you have a service with just one read action, then you do not have to actually write such a service. Auto service (on-the-fly-service) feature allows a special service name get_recordName to be used as if you have written a service with a read action using that record. Child records are read based on settings in record specification.
